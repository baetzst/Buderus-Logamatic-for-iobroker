# Buderus-Logamatic-for-iobroker
The script subscribes to an MQTT state in ioBroker that receives raw CAN bus messages from the Logamatic controller. These messages are decoded and transformed into structured data points, such as temperatures, status flags, and operational values for heating circuits, boilers, solar systems, etc.
